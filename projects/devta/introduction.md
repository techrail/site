One of the most catchy names out there for Indians under the umbrella of **Techrail** is _**Devta**_. The word **Devta** in most Indian languages means _Divine Being_ - beings that are helpful in nature and usually have divine/magical powers.

Devta, the project is originally a website which contains a number of helpful utilities for **Dev**elopers, is easy-to-use and is a fully client-side website. It contains utilities such as 

- Base64 encoder/decoder
- Multiple URL Parsers
- JSON to other format converters
- Color Picker
- Hash generator
- SQL Formatter

and a few other utilities. It is modular, written in VueJS (using Vite) and Bootstrap and is a responsive site.
