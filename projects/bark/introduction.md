title: What is Bark?
---
Bark is a small logging server that is supposed to fill in the void between **plaintext log files** and **terabyte scale dedicated logging solutions for enterprises**. 

It takes very low amount of memory, can accept a lot of requests per second and dump logs into a [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org) database.
