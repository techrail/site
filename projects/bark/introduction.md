Bark is a small logging server that is supposed to fill in the void between **plaintext log files** and **Terabyte scale,  Application Performance Monitoring and Log Aggregation and analytics solutions for enterprises**. 

It takes very low amount of memory, can accept a lot of requests per second and dump logs into a [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org) database. You can checkout the [bark repository on GitHub](https://github.com/techrail/bark) to learn about what it does in detail.
