The Reverse Job Board for Go developers

## From the Developers' perspective 
- Developers' resume gets lost in the ocean of Resumes with each company.
- Standing out becomes difficult. 
- The HR people literally can't remember all the good candidates or locate their resumes from a pool of 10K applications.

## From the company perspective
- Companies spend a lot of time and resources looking for a good employee.
- Every week more than 10 man-hours are lost on an average. 
- A company can lose up to 100 man-hours for finding one good candidate.

## Where do we come in 
- We are going to vet the skills of golang candidates before they appear for the interviews.
- This helps the company locate the right candidate much faster. 
- We prep the candidate on the technical side of the interview.
- After gauging the candidate's potential and the company's offering, we can make a great match for both sides.

## What do we _NOT_ do 
- We don't match developers and companies randomly
- We don't refer blindly; neither companies to devs nor devs to companies
- We don't do head-hunting.
- We make sure that the candidate is truly what he says he is on his Resume!
