I have been using Obsidian since quite some time and I have been tempted to buy the Obsidian Publish subscription because of two big reasons: 

1. I can write easily and forget about publishing
2. My older site theme has not been updated in quite some time by its author. 

But it was costly.

However, I just stumbled upon Quartz which does the same thing (more or less). So I am thinking to move my personal blog content here! In addition I wanna use it for documenting [Techrail project](https://github.com/techrail) related stuff too, for example, some extra documentation, details or maybe tutorials about [[introduction|bark]] can be put up here.
